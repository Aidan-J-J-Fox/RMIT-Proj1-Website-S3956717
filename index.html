  				<h1>Personal Information</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Aidan, I am a tech enthusiast and general nerd.  </p>
  				      <p>Fun Fact: I started a twitch channel as a creative exercise to learn more about different software while experiencing para-social relationships with the goal of doing it for a few months to see what I could learn. My followers and paying subscribers keep reminding me there is always more to learn and the extra pocket change from performing happens to be a nice bonus. </p>
  				          <p>Currently I live in the Barossa Valley, in Nuriootpa, South Australia. Before this I lived out on the Eyre Peninsula with a friend while working as a cleaner at a hospital </p>
                    <p>I am currently studying IT (Information Technology) with RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) University to try and professionalise my IT Skills and hopefully make a successful career out of those skills. </p>
                    <p>I currently work as a bottling attendant at Yalumba Winery performing a process called Tirage which is a more traditional way of carbonating wines. A favourite highlight of mine to bring up is that I worked at a hospital during the initial covid outbreak which tends to make people concerned until I tell them that my hospital was too small for covid patients and that we turned anyone ‘covid positive’ away to a hospital 142 kilometres away. </p>
                    <p>I would consider myself someone who has many rich interests due to a gravitational pull to learning new things, though Tech related interests will always hold my attention for far longer than random trivia. </p>

  				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  				    <p>My interest in IT began at an early age. My grandmother had a PC (Personal Computers) and games for the kids to play, but as I found out later, those were her PC games. Titles like Diablo and Dungeon Keeper were my first games. Once my parents got their own computer it was over, I had grown far too interested in that cream shelled box. </p>
              <P>once I got to high school, I expressed an interest in buying a better computer to run newer games, and a friend of mine (who was incredibly talented with IT) pointed out I could save money by building it myself, which at the time felt taboo, I made sure to learn everything I could about building computers and solving random PC related issues that I could. </p>
              <p>I maintain my knowledge of computer hardware so that it is as current as a consumer can get which means a lot of Linus tech tips videos and articles that pop up in my media aggregate. Though I hope to learn enough to gain a professional lens through which to see this hobby of mine so that I can make a career out of it </p>
              <p>I chose to study with RMIT as I have been wearing the cape and costume of an IT support worker for far too long, it has come time for me to capitalise on my skillset and expand my demographics beyond friends and family. </p>
