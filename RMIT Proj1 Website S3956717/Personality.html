  				<h1>Conclusions</h1>
  				  <p>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
            <p>they tell me that I am a person who likes things to be balanced and operate smoothly to the point where I will take action to see that they go smoothly and without preventable failings. </p>
            <p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </p>
            <p>In a team, I would be the person to reinforce co-operation and focus. This could be expressed as ‘The Glue that holds the team together’ or as ‘The village elder’ who settles disputes and consults from wisdom</p>
            <p>How should I take this into account when forming a team? </p>
            <p>while forming a team I do not need to be as concerned about competitive hotheads because I can manage them better than other types of people, however I do need to be certain that my team is not entirely composed of similar types to me due to the lack of neurodiversity that would entail </p>
