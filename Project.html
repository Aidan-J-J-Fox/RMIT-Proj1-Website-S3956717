          <h1>The Project Idea</h1>
          <p>Introduction / Overview (100 Words) </p>
          <p>For my project, I am looking to develop a phone application designed to identify and track consumers direct debits and fee charges from commitments and subscriptions.  </p>
          <p>This will allow people to better analyse their expenses to be able to budget their money more effectively. Ideally, the layout of this software will be a timeline that aggregates the information identified. Then, the system places marks on the line on dates when the consumer is expected to incur expenses.  </p>
          <p>The fundamental concept I am trying to achieve with this software is a simple to use, autonomous interface that assists people in controlling their finances and budgeting. </p>
          <p>Motivation (100 Words) </p>
          <p>In modern times, people have struggled with budgeting and grasping their financial position. This has now been made more difficult with the introduction of substantial amounts of subscriptions, micro-transactions and direct debits which are marketed to consumers to make their life more convenient and simpler. But the result of this has caused people to now struggle to grasp the plethora of ways their money is leaving their accounts and making them feel financially hopeless. </p>
          <p>There is a need in today's market to have this autonomous system that empowers average people to become better with their finances. </p>
          <p>Description (500 Words) </p>
          <p>An app in the same family as other popularly used apps such as “shop” for tracking online shopping orders; ‘Fee Tracker’ will be able to either manually or automatically add reminders of subscription fees to a timeline for users to better track their automatic expenditures. </p>
          <p>This can be accomplished via email scanning for existing or new emails with a filter for ‘automatic’ or ‘subscription’ expenditures and plotting them onto the timeline/calendar display or even list-view with a “days remaining until next bill” counter </p>
          <p>This has been done before in other phone apps however the advantages “fee-tracker” will have over the existing infrastructure on google play and the Apple App store is that this system will aggregate Twitch Subscriptions, YouTube memberships and other such services that are not affiliated together into the same page. Which for users who have not used the app store on their phones to set up these subscriptions, can be tricky to keep track of. </p>
          <p>The app can also be used to track money spent within a timeframe. Underneath the timeline there will be a panel showing a total expected money spent within a week, fortnight, or month so a user can better compare with their total income for that period. </p>
          <p>Understandably features like notification reminders might be better left for banking apps, but the option to have notifications for certain fees could be useful in case scenarios where a fee has been organised without a mobile device notification. </p>
          <p>The interface should be minimalistic as it is going to carry a lot of information in a small space, staying simple will allow for a much smoother user experience without overwhelming them with distracting shapes or colours. However, the design should not be overly minimalistic as that would detract from the richness of information able to be presented. An uncomplicated design I would like to replicate is by having a menu button that slides in a side panel for navigation purposes</p>
          <p>between a page with graphs and totals, the ‘Timeline’ view and a list view which will have access to the manual addition button to add in details for a service either not in the database or that had failed to automatically aggregate into the list. </p>
          <p>I am considering adding anti scam features to the final product if it is deemed desirable, a notification would come up when a sketchy email gets scanned but still has enough keywords to emulate a subscription receipt, then the user would be prompted to tell the app if it’s a legitimate email, if not, the user will be reminded not to click links in scam emails. </p>
          <p>Tools and Technologies (100 Words) </p>
          <p>This software is intended to be a phone application available on all mobile product providers application stores. To achieve this, I will need to make use of a diverse amount of phone compatible programming languages such as C++, Swift and Java.  </p>
          <p>I am seeking for this program to have the capability to scan through consumers emails and financial statements. To allow this to be possible I will need to implement email service API (Application Programming Interface) calls into the app. This system will filter documents for key words relating to recurring debits and periodical payments while also capturing the dollar amount attached to the expense. </p>
          <p>Skills Required (100 Words) </p>
          <p>This project will require me to utilise the Swift, Java and C++ programming languages which you can learn online for free with the help of YouTube tutorials and several helpful websites. This project also requires the use of an Email API which will require a study in the documentation included. Due to the nature of this project, it will naturally need to integrate with the app stores of the various devices, naturally, knowing how to host an app on each app store will be an important skill. </p>
          <p>Outcome (100 Words) </p>
          <p>The outcome of this project will stabilise the finances of the average user dependant on how much information they are willing to feed it. Potentially this will unlock a large amount of financial security for the average Australian resulting in overall economic stimulation that had been tied up in forgotten or mismanaged subscriptions. I passionately believe this can be done without being overly complicated or confusing for the end user and I believe my goal will be a useful tool for simplifying personal finances by giving the user the power to see where they have more freedom to spend or where they can gain wiggle room to withstand a crisis. </p>
